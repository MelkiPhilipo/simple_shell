# Function Implementations

1. `prompti`: This function could be implemented to display a prompt to the user and read their input. You could use functions like `printf` for the prompt and `getline` for reading the input.

2. `_realloc`: This function could be implemented to reallocate memory. You could use the `malloc` function to allocate new memory and `memcpy` to copy the old data to the new memory location.

3. `pata_line`: This function could be implemented to read a line from the user's input. You could use the `getline` function for this.

4. `t_uziure`: This function could be implemented to check if a character is present in a string. You could use a loop to iterate over the string and compare each character with the target character.

5. `achanana_space`: This function could be implemented to split a string by spaces. You could use the `strtok` function for this.

6. `_uzi_tok`: This function could be implemented to tokenize a string based on a delimiter. You could use the `strtok` function for this.

7. `c_uzi_tok`: This function could be implemented to tokenize a string based on a delimiter, but it first makes a copy of the string. You could use the `strdup` function to copy the string and then `strtok` to tokenize it.

8. `_uziaddto`: This function could be implemented to add a string to another string. You could use the `strcat` function for this.

9. `_uzirudf`: This function could be implemented to return a string. It could simply return the input string.

10. `_uzikopi`: This function could be implemented to copy a string to another string. You could use the `strcpy` function for this.

11. `_uzicmp`: This function could be implemented to compare two strings. You could use the `strcmp` function for this.

12. `_cd`: This function could be implemented to change the current directory. You could use the `chdir` function for this.

13. `kijenzi_chandani`: This function could be implemented to build an internal command. It could use a series of `if` or `switch` statements to determine which command to execute.

14. `isiyo_ingiliwakati`: This function could be implemented to handle signals. You could use the `signal` function for this.

15. `_niwhich`: This function could be implemented to find the path of a command. You could use the `getenv` function to get the `PATH` environment variable and then search through the directories in the `PATH` for the command.

16. `_kutoka`: This function could be implemented to exit the shell. You could use the `exit` function for this.

17. `_kuexecve`: This function could be implemented to execute a command. You could use the `fork` function to create a new process and the `execve` function to replace the current process image with a new one.

18. `frii_dabo_ptr`: This function could be implemented to free a double pointer. You could use a loop to free each pointer and then free the double pointer itself.

19. `linked_listi_huru`: This function could be implemented to free a linked list. You could use a loop to iterate through the list and free each node.

20. `_env`: This function could be implemented to manage the environment variables. It could use a series of `if` or `switch` statements to determine which action to take.

21. `pata_env`: This function could be implemented to get an environment variable. You could use the `getenv` function for this.

22. `env_linked_list`: This function could be implemented to create a linked list of environment variables. You could use a loop to iterate through the environment variables and add each one to the list.

23. `ongeza_mwisho_node`: This function could be implemented to add a node at the end of a linked list. You could use a loop to find the end of the list and then add the new node.

24. `print_orodha`: This function could be implemented to print a linked list. You could use a loop to iterate through the list and print each node.

25. `futa_nodeint_kwenye_faharisi`: This function could be implemented to delete a node at a given index in a linked list. You could use a loop to find the node at the given index and then remove it.

26. `_ondoapangaenv`: This function could be implemented to unset an environment variable. You could use the `unsetenv` function for this.

27. `_pangaenv`: This function could be implemented to set an environment variable. You could use the `setenv` function for this.

28. `tafuta_env`: This function could be implemented to search for an environment variable. You could use a loop to iterate through the environment variables and compare each one with the target variable.

29. `hai_patikani`: This function could be implemented to handle command not found errors. It could print an error message to the user.

30. `haiwezi_kucd_kwenye`: This function could be implemented to handle directory not found errors. It could print an error message to the user.

31. `namba_isiyohalali`: This function could be implemented to handle invalid number errors. It could print an error message to the user.

32. `integer_kwenda_string`: This function could be implemented to convert an integer to a string. You could use the `sprintf` function for this.
